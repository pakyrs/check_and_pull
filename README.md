# Check and Pull Script üêç

This Python script automates the process of checking if your local Git repository is behind the remote repository and performs a `git pull` if necessary. It helps keep your local repository up to date with the latest changes from the remote repository.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/check_and_pull.git
```
Change to the repository directory:

```shell
cd check_and_pull
```

Run the script:

```shell
python3 check_and_pull.py

```
    The script will check if you are behind on the remote branch. If there are new changes, it will perform a git pull to update your local repository.
## Customize

You can customize the script as needed. For example, you can change the repository URL and branch name in the check_and_pull.py file to match your specific repository.
